# data-diary

This is a template README for your data diary. Start out by making mention of the structure of the repository. What is in each folder? What files are you including? Where should the editor start when looking to reproduce your work?

### Source Data
Explain where the source data comes from.

### Data cleaning/transformation
How was the data cleaning and transformation done? Where can the editor find this? If you used excel, describe the process so that the editor can reproduce it. If you used code, point the editor to the file contaning the code. Make special note in that file of any methodological choices that the editor should review. Did you exclude some data (for example removing rows with null values) in the process of cleaning? Did you include data from one source and not another? Leave any general notes and instructions here in the README.

### Caveats
What are some caveats about the data? What can't it tell us? 

### Data analysis
How was the data analysis and visualization done? Where can the editor find instructions to reproduce your analysis?

### Questions and concerns
What are pressing questions you have for the quantitative editor that you'd like to hash out?
